# COVID19 US Tracker
 This project uses an API from [The COVID Tracking Project API](https://covidtracking.com/api/). This data is updated daily.
 This iOS app is still in development. It is alpha software and will change at anytime. It was "scratch" I wanted to "itch".
 I wanted to find out from a mobile app what the individual state data was each day. 
 
 There is still a lot of work to be done on this app. Wish list:
 1. App Icons
 2. Pull to refresh functionality
 3. CoreLocation based watched
 4. Loading spinner for WKWebView
 
 I plan to get to these over the coming days.
 
 Thanks to all the amazing healthcare people on the frontlines of the pandemic.
 
 This one is for you!
